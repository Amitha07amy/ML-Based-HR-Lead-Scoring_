# ML-Based-HR-Lead-Scoring_
I developed an ML model for HR lead scoring, first using a Random Forest Classifier without resampling, achieving decent metrics. Then, I applied XGBoost, attaining over 95% precision, outperforming RFC. After resampling and handling outliers, both models showed high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, but XGBoost proved more efficient.
